	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.charms": "Charms are new parts with Apotheosis that allows you to get Potion Effects for much longer. You can Infuse them to make them Unbreakable. It needs 50 Eterna, between 8.5 and 13.5 Quanta, and between 32.5 to 37.5 Arcana. One way you can do this is with 5 Draconic Endshelves, 6 Glowing Hellshelves, 1 Blazing Hellshelves, 1 Heart-Forged Seashelf, and 2 Melonshelves. {BTW I used any curios charm tag so some items that can be used in the quest can not be made Unbreakable, only Apotheosis Charms can.)",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.trident": "Apotheosis knows how annoying Tridents can be to get so they made it easier... well kinda easier. You can now make an Inert Trident and Infuse it to get a normal Trident. The Trident requires between 20-30 Eterna, 20%-50% Quanta, and atleast 35% Arcana. You can get this with 4 Echoing Skulkshelves or 2 Crystalline Seashelves and 6 Heart-Forged Seashelves.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.library": "This is arguably one of the most important blocks added by Apotheosis, the Enchantment Library. You put Books in and they collect over time and can be taken out anytime. Warning 1. It has limits, high limits but limits 2. It can only take out the highest level put in regardless of how many are in.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.alexandria": "The Library of Alexandria is a better Enchantment Library. It can hold more, that's it. you need to Infuse a Enchantment Library. It needs exactly 50 Eterna, between 45%-50% Quanta, and 100% Arcana. This can be done with 7 Echoing Skulkshelves and 2 Draconic Shelves.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.infused_hellshelf": "In order to get higher Max Enchantments and levels you'll need Infused Hellshelves. To get them you will need 22.5 Eterna and 30% Quanta. The best way to get that would be 15 normal shelves and 5 Hellshelves.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.infused_seashelf": "If you want higher Eterna and Arcana you'll need Infused Seashelves. To get them you need atleast 22.5 Eterna, 15% Quanta, and 10% Arcana. The best way to get that is 15 Bookshelves and 5 Seashelves. (15% Quanta is default you won't need Hellshelves for this).",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.sight": "You ever spend 3 months studying Galatic Code to finally understand Enchantment Table language just for it to be gibberish? No? Me either but Enchanting Clues are your actual translator for it. Each Enchanting Clue will tell you 1 Enchantment before you actually use it.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.retification": "Retification is a quantity that works with Quanta, it determines if the enchantments will be good or bad. The more Retification the better the Enchantments. Definitely necessary for those wanting good gear.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.blazing": "The Blazing Hellshelf is an upgrade to the Infused Hellshelf. It increases max Eterna to 30. The negative Enchanting Clue makes it a little worse for normal Enchanting, instead we can use it for better Infusion.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.glowing": "The Glowing Hellshelf is an upgrade to the Infused Hellshelf. It also increases the Max Eterna but it's not the stats we're looking for in order to Enchant. Definitely good for normal Enchanting though!",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.crystalline": "The Crystalline Seashelf is an upgrade to the Infused Seashelf. It's very good for normal Enchantments but doesn't give us enough Arcana for the next Infusion we'll need. Still good stats for normal Enchanting though!",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.heart-forged": "The Heart-Forged Seashelf is another upgrade to the Infused Seashelf. It's a little expensive but gives the Arcana we'll need for Infusion and later Enchanting. The Negative Retification makes it a little worse for normal Enchanting though as it's important for getting good Enchantments.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.deepshelf": "The Deepshelf (not dormant) is your next step to Enchanting. Like everything else it needs Infusion. The Deepshelf needs 30 Eterna, 40% Quanta, and 40% Arcana. You can get that with 5 Blazing Hellshelves and 4 Heart-Forged Seashelves.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.Soul_deep": "Like an improved Hellshelf, the Soul Touched Deepshelf gives a lot of Quanta, it does give higher Eterna max to 37.5 though! Which means better Enchants!",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.Soul_sculk": "Suprisingly you don't need infusion for these! You just need to kill the most powerful boss in vanilla Minecraft! The Skulk shelves increase Eterna to 40 which will allow us to Infuse the next item.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.echo_deep": "A little expensive but the Echoing Deep Shelf is like a much better Seashelf. (BTW you'll need to kill quite a few wardens to advance more in Enchanting... shoulda warned you earlier). Also increases Max Eterna to 37.5.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.echo_sculk": "You might need to kill a few Wardens for these but that's okay Apotheosis makes it easier! This shelf is mostly for Arcana but it's a good source for all quantities. It will be needed for next Infusion.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.endshelf": "The last sets of Shelves you'll need are Endshelves, to get them you need Infused Dragon's Breath. This one was hard to get but you need atleast 40% Eterna, 15%-25% Quanta, and atleast 60% Arcana. It has to be between 15%-25% Quanta to get that you can try 9 Echoing Skulkshelves and 4 Melonshelves or 2 Echoing Skulkshelves and 10 Heart-Forged Seashelves.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.pearlescent": "The Pearlescent Endshelf is the best all-around shelf. It also gives a Max Eterna of 45, but this isn't the shelf we're looking for to get perfect set up.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.draconic": "The Draconic Shelf is the last Shelf we'll need for perfect set up. It might only give Eterna but it has the Max Max Eterna of 50.",
	"spm.quest.enchant.desc.perfect": "Ever want THE most perfect Enchants? Then this is the setup you need, for 100% everything. 7 Echoing Skulkshelves, 4 Soul-Touched Deepshelves, and 5 Draconic Shelves will get you 50 Eterna, 100% Quanta, 100% Arcana and 8 Enchanting Clues. 4 Shelves of End Fused Retification will give 100% Retification. And Deepshelf of Arcane Treasures will top it all off with Treasure Enchantments.",
